### Foto-Finder
This was a prework we were assigned that required us to refactor an old project with ES6 and JQuery syntax.


This was a solo project to recreate a website based on its picture comp and a variety of features.

## What I gained from this project
I gained a better understanding of JSON and working in an agile vs waterfall way.
